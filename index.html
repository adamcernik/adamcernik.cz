            <section class="about">
                <p>I'm a UX & Product Designer with over 15 years of experience crafting digital experiences that balance usability, aesthetics, and business impact. Currently, I work independently, partnering with businesses to refine their digital products through strategic UX and design consulting.</p>

                <p>I've contributed to <button class="trigger-modal" data-modal-id="modal1">Deutsche Bank's</button> mobile banking experience and one of Europe's first Apple Pay integrations. My career also includes impactful roles at <button class="trigger-modal" data-modal-id="modal2">Austrian Railways (Ã–BB)</button> and <button class="trigger-modal" data-modal-id="modal3">ORF</button>, where I designed digital platforms used by millions. Previously, I was Design Lead at <button class="trigger-modal" data-modal-id="modal4">Akcenta</button>, a Czech finance company, where I managed a small team to overhaul the banking system, develop a new app, and enhance the public website.</p>

                <p>Earlier in my career, I collaborated with startups and enterprises, specializing in interaction design, user research, and prototyping to create intuitive, functional products.</p>
                
                <p>Today, I work with select clients across Germany, Austria, and beyond, offering expertise in UX strategy, product design, and digital transformation to help businesses achieve their goals through user-centered design.</p>
                
                <p>This page embodies my design philosophy: purposeful, intentional, and user-centered. I focus on creating only what's essential and communicating what truly matters. Every detail is thoughtfully crafted with your needs in mind.</p>
