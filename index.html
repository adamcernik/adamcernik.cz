    <p>I’m a UX & Product Designer with over 15 years of experience crafting digital experiences that seamlessly blend usability, aesthetics, and business impact. Currently, I work independently, partnering with businesses to refine their digital products through strategic UX and design consulting.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was part of the design team at Deutsche Bank, where I played a significant role in shaping the mobile banking experience and contributed to one of the first Apple Pay integrations in Europe. My career also includes impactful roles at Austrian Railways (ÖBB) and ORF, where I designed digital platforms used by millions of users. Earlier, I collaborated with various startups and enterprises, focusing on interaction design, user research, and prototyping to ensure products are not only functional but also truly intuitive.</p>
        
    <p>Today, I work with select clients across Germany, Austria, and beyond, offering expertise in UX strategy, product design, and digital transformation to help businesses achieve their goals through thoughtful, user-centered design.</p>

    <p>This page reflects my design philosophy—I design with purpose, creating only what’s needed and communicating only what truly matters. Every detail is crafted with you in mind.</p>
