    <!-- Content -->
            <p>Iâ€™m a UX & Product Designer with over 15 years of experience crafting digital experiences that balance usability, aesthetics, and business impact. Currently, I work independently, partnering with businesses to refine their digital products through strategic UX and design consulting.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™ve contributed to <a class="trigger-modal" data-modal-id="modal1">Deutsche Bankâ€™s</a> mobile banking experience and one of Europeâ€™s first Apple Pay integrations. My career also includes impactful roles at <a class="trigger-modal" data-modal-id="modal2">Austrian Railways (Ã–BB)</a> and <a class="trigger-modal" data-modal-id="modal3">ORF</a>, where I designed digital platforms used by millions. Previously, I was Design Lead at <a class="trigger-modal" data-modal-id="modal4">Akcenta</a>, a Czech finance company, where I managed a small team to overhaul the banking system, develop a new app, and enhance the public website. I led user feedback sessions, handled animations, and focused on mentoring my team to foster growth and improve our collective design skills.

            <p>Earlier in my career, I collaborated with startups and enterprises, specializing in interaction design, user research, and prototyping to create intuitive, functional products.</p>

            <p>This page embodies my design philosophy: purposeful, intentional, and user-centered. I focus on creating only whatâ€™s essential and communicating what truly matters. Every detail is thoughtfully crafted with your needs in mind.</p>
